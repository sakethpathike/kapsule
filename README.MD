**kapsule** is a Kotlin Multiplatform library
that wraps `kotlinx.html` with Jetpack Compose-style modifiers and layout semantics,
making static HTML generation simpler and more expressive.
Chain Modifier calls for CSS, compose layouts like in Compose,
and avoid unnecessary overhead—just clean, structured HTML.

_What you see is what kapsule can do._
> Docs are a work-in-progress. But if you're familiar with Jetpack Compose, kapsule will feel instantly familiar.
> I’ve included comments in the code for most modifiers, so your IDE's doc preview should help you out.
